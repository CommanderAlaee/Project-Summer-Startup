Summary of Ideas
==================
1) Firefighting Drone
2) Autonomous Vehicles
3) Image Generation
4) Stock market predictor ( very far fetched but yolo)

Firefighting Drone Detailed Idea
------------------
* Essentially, the drone is dispatched in a closed location, and identifies key features for firefighter.
* Locates safest path to any victims
* Transmits data in real time so algorithm can adjust for any changes
* Requirements:
  * Drone has to be able to survive fire
  * Drone has to be able to survive falling debris
* Components:
  * Raspberry pi on drone
  * LIDAR on drone
  * If possible, sonar detectors, like small arduino ones, that are used for drone boundar detection
  * Gyroscope
  * Altimeter
